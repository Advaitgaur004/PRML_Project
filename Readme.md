# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains code for a Movie Recommendation System developed as part of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) course project. The objective of this project is to comprehensively understand traditional machine learning techniques by applying them to address the task of movie recommendation. The project employs various techniques such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Hybrid Filtering, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to provide recommendations based on user preferences and movie attributes.

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens Small Latest Dataset. The system recommends movies based on user preferences or specific movie attributes. Different techniques are employed and systematically evaluated to determine the most effective approach for movie recommendation.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Contains the implementation of different recommendation techniques.
- **Data**: Stores the MovieLens dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **Reports**: Includes the project report describing the methodology, results, and discussions.
- **Web**: Hosts the web-based demo of the recommendation system using Streamlit.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Code` directory.
3. Run the desired script for the recommendation technique you want to evaluate.

## Project Deliverables
- **Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and discussions.
- **Spotlight Video**: A concise five-minute video summarizing the project's objectives, findings, and learnings.
- **Code**: Well-documented code hosted on GitHub with proper documentation and a README.
- **Project Page**: A dedicated project page linking all project materials and providing a high-level overview.
- **Web Demo**: An interactive web demo showcasing the functionality of the recommendation system.
