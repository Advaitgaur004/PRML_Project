# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System 🍿

Welcome to our Movie Recommendation System repository! 🎉 This project is a part of the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) course, aiming to dive deep into traditional ML techniques by applying them to the exciting task of movie recommendation. We've explored various methods like Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Hybrid Filtering, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and even Neural Networks to recommend movies based on user preferences and movie attributes.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Our goal is to build a robust Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens Small Latest Dataset. We're on a mission to recommend movies based on user preferences or specific movie attributes. By trying out different techniques, we're finding the most effective approach for movie recommendation.
